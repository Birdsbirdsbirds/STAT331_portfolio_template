[**My Grade:**]{.underline} I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be an A-.

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from Lab or Challenge assignments where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Working with Data

**WD-1: I can import data from a *variety* of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt, etc.).**

-   `csv` Example 1

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv-1

# Lab 2 

survey_dat <- read_csv(here("Week2", "Lab2", "surveys.csv"))

# Using read_csv() and here() to specify the file location

```

-   `csv` Example 2

*Code Feedback: Use the here() function when reading in csv files to specify the file pathway*

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv-2

# Lab 3

teacher_evals <- read_csv(here("Week3", "teacher_evals.csv"))

# Using read_csv() and here() to specify the file location


```

-   `xlsx`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-xlsx

# Practice Activity 4 Part 1

military <- read_xlsx("gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx",
                      sheet = "Share of Govt. spending",
                      skip  = 7,
                      n_max = 190,
                      na = c("..", ". .", "xxx")
                      )

```

**WD-2: I can select necessary columns from a dataset.**

-   Example selecting specified columns

```{r}
#| label: wd-2-ex-1

# Lab 4 Question 7

plot_data <- ca_childcare %>% 
  select(region_name, study_year, mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool),
               names_to = "Age_Class",
               values_to = "Median") %>% 
  mutate(Age_Class = as.factor(Age_Class),
         Age_Class = fct_recode(.f = Age_Class,
                                Infant = "mc_infant",
                                Toddler = "mc_toddler",
                                Preschool = "mc_preschool"),
         region_name = fct_reorder2(.f = region_name,
                                    .x = study_year,
                                    .y = Median))

```

-   Example removing specified columns

```{r}
#| label: wd-2-ex-2

# Lab 5 

contractor <- facebook_event_checkin %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% # changes date to a ymd format so I can more easily use `lubridate` functions
  filter(str_detect(event_name,
                    pattern = "SQL Symphony Concert"),
         date %within% interval("2017-12-01", "2017-12-31") # looks for attendees of the SQL Concert in December
         ) %>%
  group_by(person_id) %>%
  filter(n() >= 3) %>% # determines people who attended 3 times
  select(-c(date)) %>%
  distinct(.keep_all = TRUE) %>% # reduces redundant entries
  left_join(y = person,
            by = join_by(person_id == id)) %>% 
  left_join(y = drivers_license,
            by = join_by(license_id == id)) %>% # some joins to access additional data
  filter(car_make == "Tesla",
         car_model == "Model S",
         hair_color == "red",
         gender == "female") # filters by remaining demographics

```

-   Example selecting columns based on logical values (e.g., `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`, `where()`)

```{r}
#| label: wd-2-ex-3

# Lab 4 Question 7

# Modified to use starts_with("mc") rather than explicitly naming variables

plot_data <- ca_childcare %>% 
  select(region_name, study_year, starts_with("mc")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool),
               names_to = "Age_Class",
               values_to = "Median") %>% 
  mutate(Age_Class = as.factor(Age_Class),
         Age_Class = fct_recode(.f = Age_Class,
                                Infant = "mc_infant",
                                Toddler = "mc_toddler",
                                Preschool = "mc_preschool"),
         region_name = fct_reorder2(.f = region_name,
                                    .x = study_year,
                                    .y = Median))


```

## Program Efficiency

**PE-1: I can write concise code which does not repeat itself.**

-   using a single function call with multiple inputs (rather than multiple function calls)

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-one-call

# Lab 5

contractor <- facebook_event_checkin %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% # changes date to a ymd format so I can more easily use `lubridate` functions
  filter(str_detect(event_name,
                    pattern = "SQL Symphony Concert"),
         date %within% interval("2017-12-01", "2017-12-31") # looks for attendees of the SQL Concert in December
         ) %>%
  group_by(person_id) %>%
  filter(n() >= 3) %>% # determines people who attended 3 times
  select(-c(date)) %>%
  distinct(.keep_all = TRUE) %>% # reduces redundant entries
  left_join(y = person,
            by = join_by(person_id == id)) %>% 
  left_join(y = drivers_license,
            by = join_by(license_id == id)) %>% # some joins to access additional data
  filter(car_make == "Tesla",
         car_model == "Model S",
         hair_color == "red",
         gender == "female") # filters by remaining demographics
  

```

-   using `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-across

# Lab 3 Question 5

teacher_evals_clean <- teacher_evals %>% 
  rename(sex = gender) %>%
  select(course_id, teacher_id, question_no, no_participants, resp_share, SET_score_avg, 
         percent_failed_cur, academic_degree, seniority, sex) %>% 
  filter(!no_participants < 10) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(teacher_id, course_id, question_no, academic_degree, sex), as.factor))

```

-   using functions from the `map()` family

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-map-1

# Lab 9 Question 4

evals_factors <- evals %>% 
  map_if(.p = is.character,
         .f = as.factor) %>% 
  bind_cols()

```

**PE-2: I can write functions to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   Example 1: Function that operates on vectors

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-1

# Lab 10 Question 1

rescale_01 <- function(vec){
  
  stopifnot("input vector must be numeric" = is.numeric(vec),
            "input vector must have a length greater than 1" = length(vec) > 1)
  
  vec = (vec - min(vec, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
    (max(vec, na.rm = TRUE) - min(vec, na.rm = TRUE))
  
}

rescale_column <- function(df, cols){
  
  df %>% 
    mutate(across({{cols}}, rescale_01))
  
}


```

-   Example 2: Function that operates on data frames

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-2

# Lab 8 Question 3

make_filled_boxplot <- function(df, cat, num){
  
  df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = {{cat}},
               y = {{num}},
               fill = {{cat}})) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(x = as_label(enquo(cat)) %>% 
           str_replace_all("_", " ") %>% 
           str_to_title(),
         y = as_label(enquo(num)) %>% 
           str_replace_all("_", " ") %>% 
           str_to_title()) +
    theme(legend.position = "")
  
}

```

-   Example 3: Function that operates on vectors *or* data frames

```{r}

NA

```

**PE-3:I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   using `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-across

# Lab 7 Question 1

fishNAs <- fish %>%
  filter(if_any(trip:species, is.na)) %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.x))))

```

-   using a `map()` function with **one** input (e.g., `map()`, `map_chr()`, `map_dbl()`, etc.)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-1

# Lab 9 Question 3

enframe(map_chr(.x = surveys, 
                .f = class)) %>%
  mutate(value = str_to_lower(value)) %>% 
  arrange(value, name) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Variable", "Data Type"), 
        bold = TRUE,
        ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped") %>% 
  add_header_above(c("Portal Study Measurements" = 2))

```

-   using a `map()` function with **more than one** input (e.g., `map_2()` or `pmap()`)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-2

# Second example of a map() with one input! This example might take several inputs?

  bind_rows(.id = "variable") %>% 
  mutate(variable = fct_recode(variable,
                               "Academic Degree" = "academic_degree",

  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,
                bootstrap_options = "striped")


```

**PE-4: I can use modern tools when carrying out my analysis.**

-   I can use functions which are not superseded or deprecated

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I've revised my thinking several times throughout the course by taking feedback to make code more efficient or improve readability in my plots and tables. For over half of my submissions, I have resubmitted assignments where many skills were growing. There are examples here where code has been modified from my original submission (and some which has been modified expressly for use in the portfolio, denoted with comments throughout).

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->

Noted in assignment body.

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I've often extended my thinking in this course by applying previously-learned techniques in new ways. I think this is particularly true of my approach to data visualization in challenge 4. For the open-ended analysis, I opted to use HTML editing tools learned in week 2 to add some color directly to the text of my plots - improving readability on what would otherwise be a busy visual.

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). -->

![](Screenshot%20Peer%20Review%201.jpg){width="139"}

![](Screenshot%20Peer%20Review%202.jpg){width="140"}

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   -->

I think when I first started doing the pair programming activities, I stuck to my assigned role well, but didn't really know how to support my coding partner if we hit a snag (without telling them a solution I thought of directly). I think I've gotten better at prompting helpful next steps/ resources without centering my own ideas (e.g. saying this reminds me of an example we saw earlier, prompting them to look at the handouts, etc.). I've picked up those habits in part by observing how others have helped me when I hit snags, without making me feel like they were taking over my role.
